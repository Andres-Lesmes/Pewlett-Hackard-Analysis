# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  In this analysis we are working with the employee data of a company named Pwlett Hackard. The purpose of this analysis is to get the data by title of employees that are retiring soon; in order to prepare the hiring and promotion process to cover for the vacancies. Also, we are obtaining the list of employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on their age and title. The mentorship program would offer those eligible employees that are expected to be retiring in 10 years to be mentored by retiring employees.
 
## Results
  * We found that Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are the titles that have the more employees retiring.
  * We found that just 2 managers are retiring.
  * There are a total of 499,495 eligible employees for the mentorship program.
  * A good use of the mentorship program would be to use retirement elegible employees to mentor actual employees in order to be promoted to cover those high rank            job vacancies and hire lower rank new employees.
